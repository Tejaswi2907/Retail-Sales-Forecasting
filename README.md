# Retail-Sales-Forecasting
 Predicting SKU-Store Weekly Sales for the Next 12 Weeks Using Historical Data"

## Problem Statement

One of the largest retail chains in the world wants to leverage its extensive sales data to build an efficient forecasting model. The goal is to predict sales for each SKU across 76 different stores using historical week-on-week sales data from the past 3 years. Sales and promotional information are available at the product and store levels, but no additional store or product metadata is provided. The objective is to accurately forecast sales for the next 12 weeks for every product-store combination.

## Approach

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values
   - Typecasting data types for consistency

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Analysis of numerical and categorical variables
   - Correlation analysis between features
   - Identifying patterns and trends in sales data

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Creating additional relevant features for better model performance
   - Handling missing values in the training dataset

4. **Modeling**
   - Implementing and evaluating different forecasting models
   - **Linear Regression** as a baseline model

## Visualizations Used

- Missing values heatmaps
- Distribution plots for numerical variables
- Correlation heatmaps
- Sales trend analysis across different stores and products
